In this assignment you have to implement two cryptographic ciphers -
PRESENT and ESF using LogiSim. You have to design a hardware architecture for both the ciphers.

For better understanding of the requirements and the implementation part one should read Assignemnt file for the details.  
Final report is also given how I made different parts
